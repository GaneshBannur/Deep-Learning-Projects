# Deep Learning Projects
This repository is a work in progress and has code implementing different deep learning tasks. Install the required packages using
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Multi-class Classification
1. Example using MNIST and LeNet ([LeNet.ipynb](LeNet.ipynb))
2. Notebook using ResNet to classify a 150 class [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thedagger/pokemon-generation-one) ([ResNet.ipynb](ResNet.ipynb)).
  
    a. Also experimented with [VGG](models/VGG16.py) for the same dataset.
  
### Language Translation using RNNs (WIP)
### Object Detection
